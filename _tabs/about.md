**Fullstack Engineer** | **SaaS Founder** | **Army Veteran**

## The Short Version

I build things that work at scale. From enterprise dashboards serving Fortune 500 companies to SaaS platforms with 99.9% uptime, I've shipped code that real people depend on every day.

Currently based in **Seoul, South Korea**, crafting my own SaaS venture while documenting the journey here.
